A possibility is to use git installed locally on your machine for manipulating files. 
Git is available by default on Linux, I believe. 
For windows, I use 'Git for Windows', which is a Linux emulator containing git (git bash).
After installation, the first step would be to 'clone' this git repository on your local machine. 
See the following guide for this essential step and a detailed look at working with git:
