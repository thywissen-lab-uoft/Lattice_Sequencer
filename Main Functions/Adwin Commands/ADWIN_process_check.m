%Summary: This function is called when the ADWIN process is running. One
%thing we could do is periodically check if the process is still running.
%I'm not sure if that would interfere with sensative timing. So now it
%waits until the time if greater than the predicted run time for the ADWIN
%and then checks if the process is done.
